A string is an object of type String whose value is text. Internally, the text is stored as a sequential read-only collection of Char objects. There is no null-terminating character at the end of a C# string; therefore a C# string can contain any number of embedded null characters ('\0'). The Length property of a string represents the number of Char objects it contains, not the number of Unicode characters. To access the individual Unicode code points in a string, use the StringInfo object

IndexOf(Char)	Reports the zero-based index of the first occurrence of the specified Unicode character in this string.

LastIndexOf(Char)	Reports the zero-based index position of the last occurrence of a specified Unicode character within this instance.

IsNullOrEmpty	Indicates whether the specified string is null or an Empty string.

Replace(String, String)	Returns a new string in which all occurrences of a specified string in the current instance are replaced with another specified string.

Remove(Int32)	Returns a new string in which all the characters in the current instance, beginning at a specified position and continuing through the last position, have been deleted.

Split(Char[])	Returns a string array that contains the substrings in this instance that are delimited by elements of a specified Unicode character array.
