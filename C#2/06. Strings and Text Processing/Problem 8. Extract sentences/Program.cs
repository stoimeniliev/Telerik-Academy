/*
 * Problem 8. Extract sentences

Write a program that extracts from a given text all sentences containing given word.
Example:

The word is: in

The text is: We are living in a yellow submarine. We don't have anything else. Inside the submarine is very tight. So we are drinking all the day. We will move out of it in 5 days.

The expected result is: We are living in a yellow submarine. We will move out of it in 5 days.

Consider that the sentences are separated by . and the words – by non-letter symbols.
